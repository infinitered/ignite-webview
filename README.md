# Ignite WebView

## Why is this archived?

We really appreciate all the community support in the years since we first released ignite-webview. Our focus has shifted to the latest version of [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite), which does not have a plugin-based architecture ([read more here](https://shift.infinite.red/introducing-ignite-4-0-flame-1dfc891f9966)). Feel free to fork this library and continue on its legacy if you want. 

Ignite plugin for adding [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview) to a React Native project.

## Usage

```
$ ignite add webview
$ react-native run-ios
$ react-native run-android
```

To remove:

```
$ ignite remove webview
```

## WebView Example
